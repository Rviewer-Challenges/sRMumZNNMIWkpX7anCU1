# Found pairs

Found pairs is a game that consist of presenting a board with a series of face-down cards and revealing all the pairs before the time is up. The user must tap on each card to turn it over and, if two of them match when they are uncovered, they will be turned face up. If not, they will be hidden again.

**The game is won if all pairs are uncovered within the time limit.**

This game has been made with the Pokemon theme.

A local ranking to save the username and his time in complete the game, although the difficulty mode of the play.

### Music and sfx

A home music and three different songs for play. A win and lose tone too. 

### Settings

In order to manage music and sfx. I have included a dark mode too.

## Roadmap

The next additions that I will implement in the future are the next:

### Firebase implementation

In order to add a remote ranking for users. I will improve the ranking page too, adding tabs for each difficulty mode.

Statistics from play: number of failed cards tap, time in complete the game, number of pairs found chained, etc.

In order to publish it I will change the thematic by my own one.
